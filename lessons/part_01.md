# Go lessons

## Intro

This materials is a (GO) beginner's guide to learning Go programming language.
It provides an overview of Go's history and features, along with practical tips for setting up a Go development
environment and writing basic Go programs.

## History

Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language that was created at Google in 2007. The language was designed by a
team of three engineers: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, who were also involved in the development of
other programming languages like C and Unix.

Go was created to address some of the shortcomings of other programming languages, such as slow compilation times and
the need for manual memory management. Go's designers aimed to create a language that was fast, reliable, and easy to
use.

One of Go's key features is its focus on simplicity and readability. The language has a minimalistic syntax and a small
number of keywords, making it easy to learn and write code. Go also has built-in support for concurrency, allowing
developers to write efficient and scalable code for multi-threaded applications.

Go's popularity has grown rapidly in recent years, with many companies and open-source projects adopting the language
for its performance, scalability, and ease of use. Some notable projects written in Go include Docker, Kubernetes, and
the popular open-source database system, CockroachDB.

In conclusion, Go is a relatively new programming language with a rich history and many useful features. Its simplicity,
efficiency, and built-in support for concurrency make it an attractive choice for developers looking to build fast,
reliable, and scalable software.

### Go profit's

In addition to its simplicity, performance, and concurrency support, Go is also known for its rich and extensive
standard library. The standard library provides a vast array of functionality that allows developers to accomplish a
wide range of tasks, from networking and file I/O to cryptography and regular expressions.

Some of the most **commonly** used packages in the Go standard library include

- `fmt` for formatted I/O,
- `net/http` for building HTTP servers and clients,
- `encoding/json` for working with JSON data,
- `os` for handling operating system functionality like reading and writing files,
- and `testing` for writing and running tests.

Because the standard library is included with every Go installation, it reduces the need for third-party dependencies
and simplifies the development process. However, if you need additional functionality beyond what the standard library
provides, there is also a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries available for use in Go projects.

## Starting with GO

### Novices

**If you're a novice developer** looking to get started with Go, there are a few steps you can take to get up and
running quickly:

1. Install Go: The first step is to download and install the Go compiler and tools. You can find detailed instructions
   for your platform on the official Go website.

2. Learn the basics: Once you have Go installed, it's time to start learning the basics of the language. The official Go
   documentation is an excellent resource for this, and it includes a "Getting Started" guide that covers the basics of
   the language.

3. Write some code: As with any programming language, the best way to learn is by doing. Start with simple programs,
   like "Hello, World!" or a basic calculator, and work your way up to more complex projects.

4. Use the standard library: As mentioned earlier, Go's standard library is extensive and provides a wide range of
   functionality. As a novice developer, it's a good idea to become familiar with the standard library and its
   capabilities.

5. Read other people's code: One of the best ways to learn is by studying the code of more experienced developers. There
   are many open-source Go projects available on platforms like GitHub that you can explore to see how other developers
   structure their code and solve problems.

6. Participate in the community: Go has a vibrant and welcoming community of developers who are always happy to help new
   users. Join forums, mailing lists, and social media groups to connect with other developers, ask for help, and share
   your experiences.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient Go developer in no time.

### Skilled C++ (C, C#, etc) developer

**If you're a C++ developer** looking to learn Go, you'll find that many of the language concepts will be familiar,
such as pointers and memory management. However, there are some key differences that you'll want to be aware of when
starting to work with Go.

Here are a few tips to help you get started with Go as a C++ developer:

1. Learn the syntax and language features: While Go shares some similarities with C++, it has its own unique syntax and
   features that you'll want to become familiar with. Take some time to read through the Go documentation and work
   through some tutorials to get a feel for the language.

2. Understand the differences in memory management: In C++, memory management is typically handled manually through the
   use of pointers and memory allocation functions. In Go, however, memory management is handled automatically by the
   garbage collector. You'll want to become familiar with how this works and how to avoid common pitfalls, such as
   creating memory leaks.

3. Get to know the standard library: Go's standard library is extensive and includes many useful packages for working
   with things like networking, encryption, and concurrency. Take some time to explore the standard library and become
   familiar with the packages that are available.

4. Start building projects: One of the best ways to learn any programming language is to start building projects. Try
   starting with small projects that you're familiar with from your experience in C++, such as command-line tools or
   small network servers. This will help you get familiar with Go's syntax and language features while also giving you
   practical experience working with the language.

Overall, while there are some differences between Go and C++, as a skilled C++ developer, you should find that the
transition to Go is relatively straightforward. With some practice and experience, you'll soon be building robust,
efficient, and scalable applications in Go
